# Story-Inspiration

## Mission Statement

Young authors and authors with writer's block will be able to collaborate on stories or gain inspiration for stories by creating short stories from writing prompts.

### How it works...

1. Users will have access to a database of writing prompts from the web and short stories from other users.
1. Each user will be able to select a writing prompt and whether or not they would like to use another user's short story as a writing prompt.
    1. They will then be able to write their own short story based on the writing prompt that they can then save to the database for use by other users.

#### App Flow

1. A page with a random prompt from a database with a login/signup navbar and an unsaveable text area for a short story
1. A login and signup buttons will link to modal popups to display the appropriate forms for logging on and signing up
1. Once logged in the user will be able to see a list of prompts from a database
    1. Each prompt may have some subcategories depending on whether or not that prompt has any short stories associated with them
1. The user will be able to click on either the prompt or the available short story, if it exists, and be brought to a new screen
1. The user will now see they're clicked prompt/story in the prompts section with a saveable text area for them to begin creating their own short story.
    1. Each short story will be saved to a database associated with that user, but it will also be able to be shared with others for use as another user's story prompt.
